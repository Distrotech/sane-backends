==========================

 * add backend internal callibration support for Astra 2200

 * change set_window if (dev->do_color_ordering != 0) {..}
   one of the settings makes an error for Astra 6X0S scanners

 * include push-button function to SANE_START (?)

 - I will NOT add support for parallel-port and USB scanners to this backend!
