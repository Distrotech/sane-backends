Q: compiling sane aborts with error "virtual memory exhausted"
   on slackware linux with gcc. What goes wrong?

A: The optimization set by "-O2" makes problems, try which one of the following
   calls work:

   make CFLAGS="-g -Wall -O1"
   make CFLAGS="-g -Wall -O"
   make CFLAGS="-g -Wall"

Q: Will there be a support for the UMAX-parallel-port-scanners?

A: UMAX published their SCSI-protocol for scanners, but the
   parallel-port- and the USB-protocol is not published until now.
   Without such informations I will not work on a driver!

   Martin Mevald <martinmv@penguin.cz> is working on a driver!

Q: Will there be a support for the UMAX-USB-scanners?

A: UMAX published their SCSI-protocol for scanners, but the
   parallel-port- and the USB-protocol is not published until now.

   As far as I know there are no generic-USB-drivers on unix-systems in the
   moment. For linux it is worked on a driver.

   Without such informations I will not work on a driver!

Q: I get a black area at the top of the image. What's wrong?

A: This is a problem with some scsi-drivers.

   For advansys-scsi-cards update to a new kernel which includes at least
   the driver version 3.1E of the advansys-scsi-driver. Take a look at:
   http://www.advansys.com/linux.htm

Q: I want to use the scsi-card that comes with my umax scanner.
   What card is it and is it supported by my os?

A: The cards that come with the umax scanners are very simple cards.
   I suggest not to use this cards.

   If you really want to try:
   the UDS-IS11 is a DTC3181E-card based on the NCR5380-chip.
   On linux you may have the chance to get it work with the recent
   g_NCR5380-driver. The card does not have IRQ/DMA.

   Try the following option for kernel:  dtc_3181e=0x280,255  
   or use the following command:

     insmod g_NCR5380 ncr_irq=255 ncr_addr=0x280 dtc_3181e=1

     - ncr_irq=255 : no IRQ, no DMA
     - ncr_irq=254 : autoprobe IRQ
     - ncr_addr    : can be: 0x220 0x240 0x280 0x2A0 0x2C0 0x300 0x320 0x340

Q: I use linux with a NCR/Symbios logic SCSI-Controller, sane does not work
   right.

A: There are two differen drivers in the linux Kernel/modules.
   Use the BSD-driver (ncr53c8xx)!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Does SANE and the umax backend work on LinuxPPC / big endian machine ?

A: There are people using the sane-umax on a LinuxPPC (big endian) machine.

   Other people write that they can not scan on a LinuxPPC. It looks like this
   is a problem with the driver of the scsi card.

   The "MESH" SCSI card is reported to work. The NCR53C94 SCSI card
   seems not to work.
