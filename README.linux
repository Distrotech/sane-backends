Information about SCSI scanners:
================================

Under Linux, your kernel must have generic SCSI support (sg) as well as a
driver for your SCSI adapter. You may want to increase the SCSI buffer size
to increase scan speed. Details on all of the above can be found in
sane-scsi(5).

If your SCSI and sg driver are build as moduls you will need to load them
with modprobe:

# modprobe your-driver-name
# modprobe sg

You may find error messages in /var/log/messages. Look at the documentation
for your SCSI driver. Maybe you need to add options like the io port.

Now the SCSI adapter and your scanner should be visible at /proc/scsi/scsi.
Example:

# cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 06 Lun: 00
  Vendor: SCANNER  Model:                  Rev: 2.02
  Type:   Scanner                          ANSI SCSI revision: 01 CCS 

In this case the real vendor and scanner name are not shown (Mustek
Scannexpress 12000SP) but SANE will detect it nevertheless.

If your scanner is supported by SANE, scanimage -L will list it now:

# scanimage -L
device mustek:/dev/scanner' is a Mustek ScanExpress 12000SP flatbed scanner 

If this doesn't work you may have to add the right SCSI generic device name
to the configuration file. This should be documented in the man page for
your backend. To find out about the right SCSI device use tools/find-scanner:

# tools/find-scanner
find-scanner: found scanner "SCANNER  2.02" at device /dev/scanner
find-scanner: found scanner "SCANNER  2.02" at device /dev/sg0
find-scanner: found scanner "SCANNER  2.02" at device /dev/sga 

It may help to set a soft link /dev/scanner to the respective device.

If you need more information on the Linux SCSI subsystem, look at
http://www.torque.net/scsi/linux_scsi_24/index.html. Although this
documentation is about the 2.4 kernels, large parts are also valid for
older kernels. One important exception is the section on "Device Names
in devfs".

Adaptec 1542 SCSI adapter:
Using buffer sizes of more than 32768 bytes with the aha1542 driver can
lead to kernel panic. To avoid this, set --enable-scsibuffersize or
SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE to 32768, or download and install the SG driver
2.1.37 or newer from http://www.torque.net/sg.           

idescsi
The Linux kernel "Emulation of a SCSI host adapter for IDE ATAPI
devices" (idescsi) is reported to cause problems in connection with
SANE. If your scanner isn't found or you encounter segmentation faults
try to disable idescsi.
