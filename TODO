TODO (2002-12-09)

******** todo ********

backends
--------
  * Port backends to SANE2. Remove unmaintained backends.
  * Add meta backend to support sSANE 1 backends (libsane2-sane1.so?).
  * check TODO v1!

doc
---
  * Add doxygen documentation for the sanei files:
    - sanei_pio.h
    - sanei_pv8630.h
    - sanei_wire.h

  * desc files:
    - Add keywords "vendor-id" and "product-id" for SCSI and USB ids.

frontends
---------
  * Port to SANE2.
  * saned:
     - saned times out after 60 minutes. Check if the
       watchdog timer is really necessary (e.g. to avoid blocking scanners
       by one user). Maybe add a command line option to saned to set the
       timeout. Otherwise turn on TCP keep alive (where available) and
       (maybe) check the connection from server side.
     - Add IPv6 support.
     - Add support for IP ranges in saned.conf (like 10.0.0.0/8)?

  * scanimage: Check range of width and height. scanimage just uses the ranges
    from br-x and br-y but this is wrong for tl-x and tl-y != 0 and for
    SANE_UNIT_PIXEL.
  
  * scanimage: Reduce range of width and length if tlx or tly is different 
    from 0 to avoid warnings.

  * scanimage: Check handling of short string-list options.

sanei
-----
  * sanei_scsi: add new interface

  * create sanei_parport_* and remove all inb, outb,... from all backends;
    use libieee1284 if available (see
    http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/libieee1284/). Or just include this
    library into sane.

  * Check if the device file has the right type before accessing it. E.g.
    check for major/minor numbers to avoid accessing a USB file as SCSI 
    device. This is finished for sanei_scsi.c/Linux and sane-find-scanner.
    Patches for other platforms are welcome.

  * sanei_usb:
    - using only the first interface may be a problem with all-in-one devices
    - some scanners semm to provide more than one bulk-in endpoint(?) 

platform-specific
-----------------
  * Check TODO v1!

misc
----
  * Check licence issues with getopt*.c and md5.c. These files are GPLed, so
    if they are used in backends, their SANE exception will be void.

  * Remove japi.
