This branch is for developing the SANE2 standard. Don't touch the source 
code for now. Fixing spelling/grammar bugs in the standard or adding
documentation relevant for SANE2 is ok, however. If you want to change
the contents of the standard, discuss on sane-devel first.

./configure
cd doc
make sane.ps
(make sane-html)

For the HTML version, you need dlh (http://panda.mostang.com/~davidm/dlh.html)
From time to time "releases" of the standard draft will be made at
http://www.xsane.org/sane2/index.html. The HTML version of such releases
can be found at http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/sane2/.

The file sane-api-todo provides suggestions for SANE2 features.
