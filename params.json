{"name":"Sane-backends","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.debian.org/sane/sane-backends.git","body":"How to configure, build, and install SANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n=============\r\nSANE stands for Scanner Access Now Easy.\r\nThis package contains the SANE libraries (this means backends and\r\nnetwork scanning parts) and the command line frontend scanimage.\r\nYou always find the most recent version of SANE on:\r\n\r\n  http://www.sane-project.org/\r\n\r\nAt the same location there are also links to snapshots of the CVS server and\r\nsometimes beta releases of sane-backends. These are unstable development\r\nversions, so be careful when using them. Please report any problems to us. See\r\ncontact section for details.\r\n\r\nThere are several graphical frontends available for SANE, see the list at\r\nhttp://www.sane-project.org/sane-frontends.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick install:\r\n==============\r\n\r\n./configure\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n\r\nman sane\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n=============\r\n\r\nIn order to build SANE, the following tools and libraries are required:\r\n\r\n\t- GNU make: version 3.70 or newer\r\n\r\n\t- ANSI C compiler: GNU C (gcc) is recommended for best performance,\r\n\t  but any ANSI-compliant compiler should do\r\n\r\nSome more libraries are not strictly necessary to compile SANE, but some\r\nfunctionality may be lost if they are not available. Make sure that these\r\nlibraries and their respective header files are available before running\r\nconfigure. On some Linux distributions the header files are part of separate\r\npackages (e.g. usb.h in libusb-devel or libusb-dev). These must also be\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n        - libusb (>=0.1.8): Strongly recommended if you use a USB scanner.\r\n          Some backends won't work without libusb at all.\r\n\r\n        - libjpeg (>=6B): For the dc210, dc240, and gphoto2 backends.\r\n\r\n        - libieee1284 (>=0.1.5): For some parallel port backends.\r\n\r\n        - libgphoto2 (>=2.0): For the gphoto2 backend.\r\n\r\nSANE should build on most Unix-like systems. Support for OS/2, MacOS X, BeOS,\r\nand Microsoft Windows is also available. For more details look at the\r\noperating system specific README.* files. For a detailed support matrix, see:\r\n\r\n    http://www.sane-project.org/sane-support.html\r\n\r\nThis table may be out of date. Please tell us about any corrections or\r\nadditions. Please mention your operating system and platform and all the other\r\ndetails mentioned in the table. See also the contact section.\r\n\r\nPlease check that there aren't any older versions of SANE installed on your\r\nsystem. Especially if SANE libraries are installed in a different prefix\r\ndirectory (e.g. /usr/lib/) this may cause problems with external\r\nfrontends. Please remove these libraries (libsane.*, sane/libsane-*) by using\r\nyour packet manager or manually before installing this version of SANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\nSimply invoke configure in the top-level directory.  Besides the usual GNU\r\nconfigure options, there are the following SANE specific options:\r\n\r\n --disable-shared\r\n\tDon't use shared libraries.  Useful for debugging or when there\r\n\tis a problem building shared libraries.  This implicitly turns\r\n\ton --disable-dynamic --enable-static as well.\r\n\r\n --disable-dynamic\r\n\tDisable dynamic loading of backends (in the dll backend).\r\n\tconfigure normally turns on dynamic loading when it\r\n\tcan find the appropriate header files and libraries\r\n\t(<dlfcn.h> and -ldl).\r\n\r\n --enable-static\r\n        Use static libraries (turned off by default).\r\n\r\n --enable-preload\r\n        Preload backends into DLL backend.  This is useful for debugging,\r\n\twhen dynamic loading is unavailable, to reduce runtime linking\r\n\toverheads, or when you only want to distribute a single DLL with\r\n\tall backends available.  If dynamic loading or shared libraries are\r\n\tunavailable or disabled, this option is turned on automatically.\r\n\r\n --enable-scsibuffersize=N\r\n        Specify the buffer size of the buffer for SCSI commands. The default\r\n\tvalue is 131072 bytes (128 kb). This may be changed at runtime by\r\n\tsetting\tthe environment variable SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE to the desired\r\n\tvalue. The option is Linux-only at this time.\r\n\t--enable-scsibuffersize and SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE have no effect for\r\n\tthe Mustek, Umax and Sharp backends. For these backends, the buffer\r\n\tsize is set automatically and/or can be specified in the backend's\r\n\tconfiguration file. Please refer to the backend's man pages for\r\n\tdetails.\r\n\r\n--disable-translations\r\n\tDisable installation of translated backend options. If you get\r\n\terrors in the po/ directory during build, use this option.\r\n\tSee po/README for details.\r\n\r\n--enable-locking\r\n\tMeans, that some backends will use a lockfile for allowing multiple\r\n\taccess to one scanner. This is useful, i.e. one frontend is scanning\r\n\tthe button status and another one will scan. The path to the lock\r\n\tfiles is define by --localstatedir at the configure step and is\r\n\t$localstatedir/lock/sane. The default group is uucp and can be\r\n\tchanged by using --with-group=newgroup. If you do not want any\r\n\tbackend to use a lockfile, simply use --disable-locking.\r\n\r\nTo limit the backends that are compiled, set the variable BACKENDS to\r\nthe list of backends to compile.  The following will limit compiling\r\nto the epson2 and fujitsu backends:\r\n\r\n  ./configure BACKENDS=\"epson2 fujitsu\"\r\n\r\nTo limit the backends that are preloaded into the DLL, set the variable\r\nPRELOADABLE_BACKENDS.  The following will limit compiling  to the epson2\r\nand fujitsu backends but only preloads the epson2 backend:\r\n\r\n  ./configure BACKENDS=\"epson2 futjisu\" PRELOADABLE_BACKENDS=\"epson2\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to these configuration options, there are some more SANE-specific\r\noptions and many standard-options.  To get a description of available options,\r\ninvoke configure with option --help.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on debugging one of the SANE programs, we recommend to run\r\nconfigure like this:\r\n\r\n   CFLAGS=\"-g -O -Wall\" ./configure --disable-shared\r\n\r\nFor operating system specific information, look at the README.* files.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo build SANE, simply type \"make\" in the top-level directory.\r\n\r\nTo clean up the executables and libraries in the source directory, type \"make\r\nclean\". To restore everything to the status after unpacking the package, type\r\n\"make distclean\".\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation and Configuration\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nOnce the build has finished, install SANE with \"make install\".  By\r\ndefault, this will place the SANE libraries in /usr/local/lib/, the\r\nconfiguration files in /usr/local/etc/sane.d/, and the manual pages in\r\n/usr/local/man/.  The location of these directories can be overridden\r\nwith configure options; see \"configure --help\" for details.\r\n\r\nBefore running any SANE program, read the PROBLEMS file in this directory.\r\n\r\nFor information on configuring and trouble-shooting the various SANE\r\ncomponents, please refer to the manual page sane(7).\r\n\r\nThe tools/ directory contains some small programs that may be helpful. They\r\nare described in tools/README.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving\r\n========\r\n\r\nType \"make uninstall\" to remove SANE from your system. This will also remove\r\nolder versions of SANE if they have been installed at the same prefix.\r\nWarning: Your configuration files will be deleted also so make sure you have a\r\nbackup. By default the configuration files are located in the directory\r\n/usr/local/etc/sane.d/.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFor questions and general discussion about SANE contact the sane-devel mailing\r\nlist. You must be subscribed to the list to send mail. See\r\nhttp://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details.\r\n\r\nIf you want to submit a bug report or feature request please use our bug\r\ntracking system.  See http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html for details. You\r\nmay also contact the author of a specific backend directly. See the AUTHORS\r\nfile for a list of addresses.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
